SuccessfulFarming,"Wheat, soybean and corn prices climb Friday","On Friday, the CME Group's farm markets look to the wheat, soybean markets for higher movement. At the close, the Dec. corn futures closed 3¢ higher at $4.19 1/2. March corn futures settled 2¢ higher at $4.20 1/2. Nov. soybean futures closed 10¢ higher at $10.83 3/4. January soybean futures closed 8 3/4¢ higher at $10.81 1/4. Dec. wheat futures closed 10¢ higher at $6.32 3/4. Dec. soymeal futures settled $4.00 per short ton higher at $386.40. Dec. soy oil futures closed 0.42 cent higher at 34.11¢ per pound. In the outside markets, the NYMEX crude oil market is $0.89 per barrel lower (2.19%) at $39.75. The U.S. dollar is lower, and the Dow Jones Industrials are 28 points (0.10%) lower at 28,335 points. Private exporters reported to the USDA export sales of 100,000 metric tons of corn for delivery to unknown destinations during the 2020/2021 marketing year. The marketing year for corn began Sept. 1. Bob Linneman, Kluis Advisors, says that the showdown between the farmers that have the grain and the endusers that need it is on. ""Corn is now trading in the key resistance zone between $4.10 and $4.20. Based on the strong basis levels in many areas, grain is moving to town slowly. Farmers are holding--or intending to hold--as many bushels as they possibly can. Those commercial grain companies that have contracted export business to China will have to find a way to get those bushels out of the famers' hands soon, or they will run the risk of having to scramble when those trains need to head to the ports,"" Linneman told customers in a daily note. He added, ""As the election nears, all markets are subject to increased volatility. It would be quite impressive for the grains to remain steadfast in their trend if the outside markets see a significant pullback."" -------------------------------------- Thursday's Grain Market Revie On Thursday, following a weak start, the CME Group’s farm markets close slightly higher. At the close, the Dec. corn futures closed 2½¢ higher at $4.16½. March corn futures settled 1¼¢ higher at $4.18½. Nov. soybean futures settled 1¾¢ higher at $10.73¾. January soybean futures closed ¾¢ higher at $10.72¼. Dec. wheat futures closed 4¢ lower at $6.25¾. Dec. soymeal futures finished $3.60 per short ton higher at $382.40. Dec. soy oil futures closed 0.49¢ higher at 33.69¢ per pound. In the outside markets, the NYMEX crude oil market is $0.63 per barrel higher (0.63%) at $40.66. The U.S. dollar is higher, and the Dow Jones Industrials are 181 points (0.64%) lower at 28,392 points. On Thursday, private exporters reported to the USDA the following activity: Export sales of 152,404 metric tons of soybeans for delivery to Mexico during the 2020/2021 marketing year. Export sales of 132,000 metric tons of soybeans for delivery to unknown destinations during the 2020/2021 marketing year. Export sales of 130,000 metric tons of white wheat for delivery to South Korea during the 2020/2021 marketing year. The marketing year for wheat began June 1; soybeans began Sept. 1. Separately, the USDA’s Weekly Export Sales Report Thursday shows strong demand figures. Corn = 1.83 million metric tons vs. the trade’s expectations of between 800,000 mmt and 1.4 mmt. Soybeans = 2.22 million metric tons. vs. trade’s expectations of 1.5 mmt to 2.5 mmt. Of that total, China bought 1.59 million metric tons. Wheat = 367,500 mt. Soybean meal = 321,900 mt. Bob Linneman, Kluis Advisors, says that corn futures have rallied to a new high and are now in a critical area on the charts. “The $4.10 to $4.20 range has been the window for the top over the past few years, whenever futures managed to get that high. It is worth noting that the timing of those prior highs was during the summer rally, not during harvest like we are currently experiencing. Soybean futures came within a few pennies of a new high on Wednesday, as rumors of another five to six cargos were sold to China,” Linneman told customers in a daily note. He added, “As long as the bull spreads in the corn and soybean markets remain strong, this bull rally will stay intact. If the spreads roll over, then that will be the warning flag for a larger correction lower.” ------------------- Wednesday’s Grain Market Review On Wednesday, investors closed the CME Group’s farm markets higher. At the close, the Dec. corn futures finished 5¢ higher at $4.13. March corn futures finished 3½¢ higher at $4.16. Nov. soybean futures closed 8¢ higher at $10.72. January soybean futures ended 7¼¢ higher at $10.71. Dec. wheat futures closed 2¼¢ lower at $6.29¾. Dec. soymeal futures settled $6.90 per short ton higher at $378.80. Dec. soy oil futures closed 0.11 cent lower at 33.20¢ per pound. In the outside markets, the NYMEX crude oil market is $1.65 per barrel lower (3.91%) at $40.05. The U.S. dollar is lower, and the Dow Jones Industrials are 10 points (0.04%) lower. Al Kluis, Kluis Advisors, says that investors should be watching the price difference between the November 2020 soybean contract and the January 2021 contract. “Dry weather concerns in the U.S. southern Plains and Russia are driving world wheat prices higher,” Kluis told customers in a daily note. He added, “Watch the spread between November 2020 and January 2021 soybeans. In late September, the January contract closed 7¢ over the November contract. Now the spread is at even money. It is unusual that cash soybean bids moved out to the January 2021 contract in mid-October. It appears that grain companies do not want to be caught short the November contract for the cash soybeans they are buying.” ------------------- Tuesday’s Grain Market Review On Tuesday, the CME Group’s farm markets add to the week’s gains. At the close, the Dec. corn futures finished 3½¢ higher at $4.08¾. March corn futures closed 2¾¢ higher at $4.13. Nov. soybean futures closed 9½¢ higher at $10.63¾. January soybean futures ended 9¾¢ higher at $10.63¾. Dec. wheat futures settled 5¢ higher at $6.32. Dec. soymeal futures closed $1.30 per short ton lower at $371.90. Dec. soy oil futures closed 0.78¢ higher at 33.31¢ per pound. In the outside markets, the NYMEX crude oil market is $0.68 per barrel higher (1.67%) at $41.51. The U.S. dollar is lower, and the Dow Jones Industrials are 264 points (0.63%) higher. On Tuesday, private exporters reported to the USDA export sales of 132,000 metric tons of soybeans for delivery to unknown destinations during the 2020/2021 marketing year. The marketing year for soybeans began Sept. 1. Jason Roose, U.S. Commodities, says that there is plenty of market support to go around. “Grains continue to find support with light producer selling and strong export demand. Plus, the weak U.S. dollar continues to weaken, which is attractive to foreign buyers. Slow planting progress in Brazil and potential import tax has made early sellers nervous. For these reasons, exports will be closely watched the next few weeks if trend continues,” Roose says. Al Kluis, Kluis Advisors, says there is good reason to believe the markets can go higher. “As long as the prices of corn and soybeans continue higher in China, U.S. prices will be well supported on any setback. Corn futures on the Dalian Commodity exchange in China are trading at $9.60 this morning and soybean prices at $19.82. Even if you figure a $1.50-per-bushel freight cost, U.S. prices are still quite low for Chinese end users,” Kluis told customers in a daily note. He added, “A lot of corn exports were announced again on Monday, and grain prices in China were sharply higher. The USDA weekly crop report showed corn harvest at 60% complete and soybean harvest at 75%.” ---------------------- Monday’s Grain Market Review On Monday, the CME Group’s farm markets close stronger. At the close, the Dec. corn futures finished 3¼¢ higher at $4.05½. March corn futures closed 3½¢ higher at $4.10¼. Nov. soybean futures closed 4¼¢ higher at $10.54½. January soybean futures finished 3¾¢ higher at $10.54. Dec. wheat futures settled 1¾¢ higher at $6.27. Dec. soymeal futures closed $5.70 per short ton higher at $373.20. Dec. soy oil futures finished 0.46¢ lower at 32.53¢ per pound. In the outside markets, the NYMEX crude oil market is $0.02 per barrel higher (0.05%) at $40.90. The U.S. dollar is lower, and the Dow Jones Industrials are 202 points (0.71%) lower. On Monday, private exporters reported to the USDA: Export sales of 345,000 metric tons of corn for delivery to unknown destinations during the 2020/2021 marketing year. Export sales of 123,000 metric tons of corn for delivery to Mexico during the 2020/2021 marketing year. The marketing year for corn began Sept. 1. Jack Scoville, PRICE Futures Group, says that the strong overnight did not carryover to the daytime trading. “Wheat was higher but found some spec selling on forecasts for a narrow line of rain to form in Russia and some forecasts for sporadic rains in the Great Plains. None of this will help, but the market is higher and susceptible to this. Beans and corn are off the day’s highs, as soybean planting gets cranking in Brazil and U.S. corn had announcements on the daily export sales monitor. The COT report showed spec selling into commercial buying. This is unusual, given the recent rally and shows how big the demand has been,” Scoville says. Al Kluis, Kluis Advisors, says that the markets are setting up an acreage battle for 2021. “The USDA Crop Progress report today will show corn harvest at about 60% complete and soybean harvest at 78%. The crop is getting put away really fast and a lot of fall tillage is done. This sets up more corn and soybean acreage and less prevent plant in 2021. The acreage war will intensify next spring,” Kluis told customers in a daily note. He added, “Will China step in and continue to buy large amounts of corn and soybeans this week? With harvest over 50% for both corn and soybeans, I expect both export buyers and U.S. end users to again be active buyers in the cash and futures markets. With corn trading at $9.60 a bushel, soybeans at over $18 a bushel in China, and the U.S. dollar at 93%, our prices are a good value to the Chinese importers.”",1603485188000,https://www.agriculture.com/markets/analysis/ag-markets-start-the-week-higher-monday,Mike McGinnis,https://www.agriculture.com/markets/analysis/ag-markets-start-the-week-higher-monday,"[""commodity prices""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SuccessfulFarming,"Farmers are urged to stay alert on marketing grain, analyst says","The last several weeks have been more than just a little interesting in the grain markets. Corn prices have rallied near $0.90, despite current forecasts for this year’s crop to be the second largest on record. With over 50% of the crop harvested, basis remains strong and yield numbers high. This may very well be the second largest crop on record. Soybean prices have been even more impressive, rallying from the mid $8.00 to over $10.50. Wheat, despite world record projected carryout, has climbed over $1.50 as well, and continues to look as though it may move higher. The emotion of bull markets is often more stressful than bear markets. Why is that? It’s probably a simple analysis of emotion. When you decide to sell in a bull market, you’re likely feeling regretful if prices continue to move higher or lower. Either you should not have sold, or you didn’t sell enough. Compare this to a bear market: Perhaps you make some sales, and as prices drop, you feel in good company because it’s likely that most farmers didn’t make additional sales either. Every producer knows there’s a year lurking where prices begin to move higher and, rather than make a moderate price rally, accelerate higher. Is 2020 a year of acceleration? It might be, as prices continue to climb despite good crops. The focus is on demand and weather. China continues to be a strong buyer. With the trade deal in place, China has indicated it will make good on its agreement to purchase huge quantities of ag products. The script may have not been written any better. China indicated they would buy beans when needed and at the right price. Price is always relative to supply availability, so it’s a vague notion. However, the need is there. Internally, China is experiencing high prices for their own commodities, while at the same time, rebuilding its livestock and poultry herds after a massive bout with African swine fever. Weather has become an important factor, as the western half of the U.S. remains on high alert because of drought conditions. Dry weather has created a scenario where planting conditions in South America are well behind schedule. This implies more potential demand for U.S. products, as both the soybean and corn crops will not deliver product to the world in a timely fashion. Russia continues to struggle with extreme dry conditions as well. As the leading exporter of wheat to the world, attention is focused on future supply availability. Weather can create demand. If end users believe a shortfall of supply could occur, pre-emptive buying increases dramatically. Possibly, that’s what is currently happening worldwide. Don’t fall asleep at the switch. Last year, corn prices peaked in October and never looked back until bottoming this August. Demand can be fleeting and more perceptive in nature. If weather conditions improve in South America or elsewhere, prices may be on the decline. This is a scenario that must be taken seriously because of the amount of investment money that has purchased commodities. Should money leave the marketplace, there could be a hollow swooshing sound as prices collapse. The key, however, is a balanced approach. If you have bills to pay and a family to care for, you can’t afford not to sell into a rally. Your risk is too high. Reward rallies and keep your pay raise. Consider reinvesting a portion of the rally dollars by retaining ownership by purchasing call options. If, in fact, the dry weather patterns and money flow continue to lead to a major bull market, prices could be just beginning to make a bigger move. If not balanced, it is almost certain you will struggle with the emotion of regrettable decisions. Pay attention to the news, and more importantly, implement strategy. Have conversations with your advisor on how to implement a balanced approach of selling and re-owning in a responsible manner. ---------------------- If you have comments, questions, or suggestions, contact Bryan Doherty at Total Farm Marketing.

SuccessfulFarming,Taps and reservoirs run dry as Moroccan drought hits farmers,"* Rainfall in Morocco ever more erratic * Two fifths of country's jobs are in farming * Water cut at night in city of Agadir * Farms losing crops, costly imports rising By Ahmed Eljechtimi RABAT, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Two years of drought have drained reservoirs in southern Morocco, threatening crops the region relies on and leading to nightly cuts in tap water for an area that is home to a million people. In a country that relies on farming for two jobs in five and 14% of its gross domestic product (GDP), the problems caused by increasingly erratic rainfall and the depletion of groundwater are growing every year. In the rich citrus plantations of El Guerdan, stretching eastward from the southern city of Agadir, more than half of farmers rely on two dams in the mountains of Aoulouz, 126 km (78 miles) away, to irrigate their trees. However, that water has been diverted to the tourist hub of Agadir, where mains water has been cut to residential areas every night since Oct. 3 to ensure taps in households did not run entirely dry. ""The priority should go to drinking water,"" Agriculture Minister Aziz Akhannouch said in parliament last week. In El Guerdan, Youssef Jebha's crop of clementine oranges has been compromised by reduced water supply, he said, which affects both the quality of fruit and the size of the harvest. ""The available ground water is barely enough to keep the trees alive,"" said Jebha, who is head of a regional farmers' association. ""Saving Agadir should not be at the expense of El Guerdan farmers,"" he added, speaking by 'phone. 'WE HOPE FOR RAIN' El Guerdan is not alone in facing drought. Morocco's harvest of cereals this year was less than half that of 2019, meaning hundreds of millions of dollars of extra import costs. Despite lower production, Moroccan exports of fresh produce have risen this year by 8%. Critics of the government's agricultural policy say such sales are tantamount to exporting water itself, given the crops use up so many resources. A report by Morocco's social and environmental council, an official advisory body, warned that four fifths of the country's water resources could vanish over the next 25 years. It also warned of the risks to social peace due to water scarcity. In 2017, 23 people were arrested after protests over water shortages in the southeastern city of Zagora. In January the government said it would spend $12 billion on boosting water supply over the next seven years by building new dams and desalination plants. One $480 million plant, with a daily capacity of 400,000 cubic meters, is expected to start pumping in March, with the water divided between residential areas and farms. Until then, ""We hope for rain,"" the agriculture minister said in parliament. In El Guerdan, the farmers are digging for water. A new well costs $20,000-30,000. However, ""there is no guarantee water can be found due to the depletion of ground reserves,"" said Ahmed Bounaama, another farmer.

SuccessfulFarming,Ukraine's grain exports down 15.8% in 2020/21 season,"KYIV, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Ukraine's grain exports have fallen to 13.84 million tonnes so far in the July 2020 to June 2021 season from 16.43 million tonnes in the same period last year because of much lower corn volumes, the economy ministry said on Monday. Traders had sold 1.09 million tonnes of corn as of October 19 compared to 2.94 million tonnes exported by the same date last year. Wheat exports have declined to 9.59 million tonnes from 10.20 million tonnes. The total export volume also included 3.11 million tonnes of barley. Ukraine accounts for about 16% of global grain exports, and sold 56.7 million tonnes of grain to foreign buyers in the 2019/20 season.

SuccessfulFarming,"GRAINS-Soybeans consolidate amid firm Chinese demand, corn hits 1 yr high","* Soybeans rise on Chinese buying, Brazil dryness * Corn lifted by delayed crops in Argentina, Brazil (Adds details, quote) By Naveen Thukral and Maytaal Angel SINGAPORE/LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Chicago soybeans steadied on Thursday following two days of gains that came amid continued strong demand from China and dry weather in Brazil. Corn was flat after hitting its highest in a year, while wheat futures gained more ground. ""It is the same story for the soybean market for around a month now. Chinese demand is driving prices higher,"" said Ole Houe, director of advisory services at broker IKON Commodities in Sydney. ""Things are not getting better in Brazil."" The most-active soybean contract on the Chicago Board Of Trade (CBOT) was down 0.4% at $10.51-1/3 a bushel by 1152 GMT, after gaining 1.2% on Wednesday. Corn was flat at $3.96-1/2 a bushel, having hit its highest in a year at $4.00, and wheat gained 1.1% to $6.03-1/4 a bushel, having closed up 0.5% on Wednesday. ""The delayed (corn) crops in Argentina and also Brazil will need watching into 2021,"" said CRM AgriCommodities in a note. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said private exporters sold 420,000 tonnes of U.S. corn to China for delivery in the 2020/21 marketing year. The USDA also reported 264,000 tonnes of U.S. soybean sales to China on Wednesday morning. Rains in Brazil have been patchy, threatening the country's soybean planting cycle, experts said. Commodity funds were net buyers of CBOT corn, soybeans, soymeal, wheat and soyoil futures contracts on Wednesday, traders said. Strategie Grains has raised its outlook for soft wheat exports from the European Union and Britain in 2020/21, citing better competitiveness on world markets after a rise in Black Sea wheat prices. Jordan is tendering to buy 120,000 tonnes of milling wheat which can be sourced from optional origins, while Japan bought 87,110 tonnes of food quality wheat from the United States and Canada in a regular tender. South Korea purchased about 60,000 tonnes of corn expected to be sourced from Brazil in an international tender Thursday. . (Editing by Kirsten Donovan) © Copyright Thomson Reuters 2020.

SuccessfulFarming,GRAINS-Chicago prices hit new highs as dry weather unsettles market,"* Wheat hits new 5-year top, soybeans fresh 2-year peak * Corn also extends run to new 8-month high * Dry U.S., Russia, Brazil weather still in focus (Updates with European trading, changes byline/dateline) By Gus Trompiz and Naveen Thukral PARIS/SINGAPORE, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat and soybean futures set fresh multi-year highs on Thursday while corn reached a new eight-month peak as dry weather in several exporting countries continued to fuel buying. Dry planting conditions for wheat in Russia and the U.S. Plains and for soybeans in Brazil have unsettled grain markets and encouraged investment fund flows, despite projections of large global production. ""Concerns about drought in key growing areas are still continuing to lend buoyancy,"" Commerzbank said in a note. The United Nations food agency on Thursday said global cereal output remained on course for a record in 2020, although it slightly trimmed its previous forecasts. But brisk international demand, notably from China, and relatively low inventories in some exporting countries have led some investors to see potential market tensions if current planting cycles are disrupted. U.S. agricultural exports to China hit $2.15 billion in August, the highest ever for the month, led by strong soybean exports. Traders were awaiting weekly U.S. export data later on Thursday for an update on overseas demand. The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) was up 1.4% at $6.16-1/4 a bushel, as of 1201 GMT, just off an earlier high of $6.16-3/4, a level last seen on June 30, 2015. CBOT soybeans were up 1.2% at $10.63-1/2 a bushel, after earlier reaching its highest since late April 2018. Corn was added 1.1% to $3.93 a bushel, close to an earlier 8-1/2 month peak. The wheat market was focused on developments in Russia. The country upgraded its forecast for the 2020/21 grain export surplus by 5 million tonnes to 50 million, but confirmed it is planning an export quota for January-June. Commodity funds were net buyers of CBOT wheat, corn, soybean and soymeal futures contracts on Wednesday, and net sellers of soyoil futures, traders said. Financial investors further increased their net long position in Euronext wheat futures and options last week.

AgFax,"Farmer Sentiment Rises as Crop Prices Rally, USDA Announces CFAP 2 – Ag Barometer","U.S. agricultural producers became more optimistic again in September as the Purdue University-CME Group Ag Economy Barometer climbed to 156, the highest reading for the index since the pandemic began last winter and 12 points higher than one-month earlier. The index is up 38 points since July and is 60 points higher than its 2020 low established back in April.
In September, producers were more optimistic about both current conditions and the future for agriculture than they were in August. The Current Conditions Index, with a reading of 142, was 18 points higher compared to a month earlier and the Future Expectations Index rose 9 points to a reading of 163.
The Ag Economy Barometer is calculated each month from 400 U.S. agricultural producers’ responses to a telephone survey. This month’s survey was conducted from September 21-25, 2020.
The improvement in the barometer and its two primary sub-indices occurred against the backdrop of USDA’s September 18th announcement of the second round of Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP 2) payments for U.S. agricultural producers. The program provides up to $14 billion in additional assistance to agricultural producers determined to have suffered from market disruptions and costs because of COVID-19.
Program details were released on September 21st, just as data collection for this month’s survey began. Additionally, fall harvested crop prices strengthened from the time data was collected for the August to the September surveys, in a continuation of a rally that got underway in late summer.
For example, in west-central Indiana cash corn prices rose nearly $0.20 per bushel from late August to late September, while cash soybean prices rose nearly $1 per bushel. The resulting revenue boost from these two sources likely provided much of the impetus for this month’s 18-point rise in the Index of Current Conditions and the 12-point rise in the Ag Economy Barometer.
The improvement in current conditions helped make producers more confident that now is a good time to make large investments in their farming operations than they were in August. The Farm Capital Investment Index rose again in September to a reading of 73, the highest reading of 2020.
Helping to confirm the optimism evident in the investment index, fewer producers in September than in August and prior months, said they planned to reduce their machinery purchases compared to a year earlier.
Farmers’ optimism carried through to their perspective on farmland values over the upcoming year. More producers in September said they expect farmland values to rise over the next 12 months than in August.
The longer-run optimism about farmland values expressed in August continued in September as the percentage of producers expecting farmland values to rise over the next 5 years was unchanged at 59%, which is still the highest reading of this year.
Although export sales to China have been rising in recent weeks, producers were, somewhat surprisingly, a bit less optimistic about future agricultural trade prospects in September than they were in August. In September, 58 percent of respondents said they expect ag exports to increase over the next 5 years, down from 67 percent who felt that way in August.
The shift occurred because more producers said they expected exports to remain about the same in the future, rather than increase. In a related question, producers were asked whether they expect China to fulfill the food and agricultural import requirements established in the Phase One trade agreement signed earlier this year.
Farmers’ opinions were split regarding Phase One’s prospects with just less than half (47%) of respondents indicating they expect China to fulfill its commitment to import food and ag products from the U.S.
Increasingly educational events and programs are transitioning to online delivery as a result of the pandemic. Twenty-two percent of respondents to the September survey said they attended an online educational program or field day this year.
When asked what aspects of these programs they liked, the two most popular responses were flexible timing of attending and viewing the programs (27%) and the ability to choose topics of interest (21%) followed by quality of presentations (16%), opportunity to earn continuing education credits (14%), and opportunities to ask questions (13%).
When asked what aspects of these programs they disliked respondents overwhelmingly pointed to the lack of interaction with other attendees (40%) followed by a poor broadband connection (18%), difficulty in asking questions (17%), and poor quality of presentations (14%).
Cover crop usage has received a lot of attention in recent years. To learn more about cover crop usage, this month’s survey included several questions on cover crops. Nearly 4 out of 10 corn/soybean producers in the September survey said they intend to plant at least some cover crops in fall 2020.
Two-thirds of the farmers who intend to plant a cover crop this fall have been planting cover crops for more than four years whereas just 7 percent of respondents said this would be the first time they planted a cover crop on their farm.
Although nearly 40 percent of corn/soybean producers said they intend to plant cover crops this fall, most of them will only plant cover crops on a portion of their crop acreage.
Just over half (52%) of the respondents using cover crops in 2020 said that they intend to plant cover crops on one-third or less of their corn/soybean acreage while 21 percent of the farms in the September survey said they intend to plant cover crops on one-third to as much as two-thirds of their corn/soybean acreage.
The remaining 27 percent of producers planting cover crops this fall intend to do so on more than two-thirds of their corn/soybean acreage. Farmers who intend to plant cover crops this fall overwhelmingly (79%) said their primary reason for doing so was to improve soil health and crop yields, while just 1 percent of respondents said it was because of the availability of cost-share funds.
Farmer sentiment improved again in September as the Ag Economy Barometer rose 12 points from a month earlier. The rise in the barometer was fueled in large part by producers’ improved perception of current conditions as the Index of Current Conditions rose 18 points above the August reading.
USDA’s announcement of the second round of CFAP payments to agricultural producers and the ongoing rally in fall crop prices were likely the two primary drivers behind the improvement in farmer sentiment. Ag producers were also more optimistic about making investments in their farming operation and about the short-run outlook for farmland values than they were in August.
Farmers’ opinions regarding whether or not China would fulfill its Phase One trade agreement commitments to the U.S. were split, with slightly less than half expecting China to meet its import commitments.
